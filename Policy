Although there are many Bloody Alcohol Trackers out on the app store (this got rejected) I made this to introduce a different kind of interface and reduce the amount of user input required to give a decent estimate of a regular peron's BAC according to World Health Organisation's data for a Standard Drink. 
Current Features
- Geolocation with World Health Organisation's Standard Drink JSON data.
- Calculates remaining BAC
- Data presented in a clear manner
If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me.
